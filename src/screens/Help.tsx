When you confirm the order (or save it as confirmed), BoxBook takes the paper from the best-fitting reels by itself, if all of that grade is in stock. If something is short you get a message saying which grade and how many kg, and nothing is taken for that grade. Turn this off in App settings → Paper stock if you prefer to issue by hand.',

The one with the least side trim comes first, so part-used reels get finished before new ones. A wider reel costs more kg because the extra width is trimmed off; the suggested kg already includes that.',
